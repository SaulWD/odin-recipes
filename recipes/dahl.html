    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1-2 tbsp coconut oil or other neutral oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 onions chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves minced</li>
        <li>2 tsp ginger minced (or more to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric
        </li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp red paprika powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala or other curry powder to taste</li>
        <li>1 ⅔ cups (300 g) dry red lentils</li>
        <li>3 ¼ cups (780 ml) vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 cup (240 ml) coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 cup (240 ml) strained tomatoes or chopped tomatoes, optional</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tsp coconut sugar or to taste</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp lime or lemon juice or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the coconut oil in a skillet or saucepan. Add the chopped onions, and sauté for 2-3 minutes until translucent. Then add the garlic and ginger sauté for another minute until fragrant. Lastly, add the spices, and sauté for a few seconds to unfold flavors.</li>
        <li>Place the lentils in a fine-mashed sieve and rinse until cold running water. Then add them to the onion mixture in the skillet. Pour in the vegetable broth, stir to combine, and bring to a simmer. Cook covered for 8-10 minutes, or until the lentils have absorbed most of the liquid.</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk and strained tomatoes (if using) and simmer another 5-10 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. (If the sauce is too thick, add a little more broth or coconut milk, until the desired consistency is reached). Season with salt, pepper, coconut sugar, and lime juice to taste.</li>
        <li>Garnish your dahl with a swirl of non-dairy yogurt, fresh chopped parsley or coriander, and sesame seeds or other toppings you like. Serve over rice or with homemade vegan naan or aloo paratha or use it as a filling for your favorite hearty pancake, crêpes, or tortilla recipe. Enjoy!</li>
